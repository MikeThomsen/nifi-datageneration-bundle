    <p>This processor is powered by the avro-random-generator library from Confluent. This library defines and uses additional
    metadata for Avro to set up rules for generating random data. Documentation for those additions can be found
    <a href="https://github.com/confluentinc/avro-random-generator/">here</a>. The additions are compatible with standard Avro
    and the NiFi Record API.</p>
